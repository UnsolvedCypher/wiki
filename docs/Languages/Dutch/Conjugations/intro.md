# The stem

To conjugate a verb, you'll need its stem. To get the stem, simply remove the -en from the end of the verb.

There are a few special cases:
* long vowels in the infinitive must remain long in the stem (like weten => weet)
* stems cannot end in two of the same consonant, so one is dropped (like missen => mis)
* stems cannot end with v or z, instead the letters become f and s, respectively
