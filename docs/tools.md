# Useful Software and Sites

_This list is very much a work in progress..._

## System Utilities (I run Arch Linux, many of these tools are cross-platform though)
- Chrome: a really nice browser
- Guake: a configurable terminal that overlays your screen when you hit a certain key
- zsh with oh-my-zsh: a better shell than bash ([list of features here](https://code.joejag.com/2014/why-zsh.html))
- Dvorak: a superior keyboard layout to QWERTY that optimizes the location of every letter for speed and comfort
- AutoKey: a text expander for Linux that lets you type abbreviations to expand to words
    - I start all of my abbreviations with a semicolon so they aren't confused with other words
    - This is very useful for emails and job applications. I have a ";addr" abbreviation that expands to my address, and a ";lin" that expands to my LinkedIn URL, etc
- trizen: a simple AUR package manager (only relevant for Arch Linux users)
- LastPass: keeps track of your passwords easily for free
    - This syncs over the internet. If that bothers you and you prefer a FOSS solution, try KeePass. However, you'll need to sync between your devices yourself
- GRUB2: now known just as GRUB, it is the best bootloader

## Software Development
- JetBrains IDEs: very good IDEs for a variety of languages (particularly useful for languages with lots of libraries like Java, C#, etc)
  - These are free for students
- Visual Studio Code: open source text editor with a boatload of features
- GitLab: like GitHub, but with more features (like free private repos!)
- Jekyll: awesome static site generator with lots of themes, powered by Markdown
- MkDocs: markdown-powered wiki/documentation tool that powers this site
- Netlify: free and super easy static site hosting with nice features like SSL and auto-update from git repositories
- Formspree: free form submission handling for static sites

## Learning
- Quizlet: flashcard website with many pre-made sets
- Memrise: similar to Quizlet, but powered by spaced repetition
